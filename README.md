This is a side project that I decided would be a fun project to code

Inspired by Snake Discovery's videos about snake breeding (particularly hognose snakes). And because I thought this could possibly
 be my capstone for both Math and CS.

This respository is just the pure java backend, so nothing fancy here. If you want to test this out, you need to manually create
 and breed the animal using the main method. I am hopefully going to fork this code (once working) into a new repository for
 the actual app but that is for a future Makenna to do so no promises.
