This is a side project that I decided would be a fun project to code

Inspired by Snake Discovery's videos about snake breeding (particularly hognose snakes). And because I thought this could possibly be my capstone for both Math and CS.

This respository is just the pure java, so nothing fancy here. If you want to test this out, you need to manually create and breed the animals using the main method. I am hopefully going to fork this code (once working) into a new repository for the actual app but that is for a future Makenna to do so no promises.

This is supposed to be realistic to the best of my ability as someone who's experience in biology is up the AP Bio. So not much, please be kind if it is not fully realistic. Comment for any changes.

This project is: UNFINISHED
